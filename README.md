# Git Uploader

## Dependencies:

As GitUp is a very simple script, it depends on only two packages:

- `bash`
- `git`

## Installation:

Run `./INSTALLER` script as root user (or maybe using `sudo`).

## Commands included:

Just type `gitup` and see the magic...

## TO-DO:

- [ ] Add more commands.
- [ ] Fix issues

## Releases:

### Upcoming:

- 0.3 "Euphonium"

### Lastest:

- [0.2 "Drums"](https://github.com/feskyde/gitup/releases/tag/v0.2).

### Old:

- [0.1 "Castanets"](https://github.com/feskyde/gitup/releases/tag/v0.1).

## Script known issues:

- Some skeleton variables are broken:
  - ´OPTIONS=""´: you need to put an "\n" on every new line (enabled by default).
  - ´ASCII=""´: prompt is buggy (disabled by default).

If you can donate some bits of code for fixing those issues, make a pull request and you can appear on the "Collaborations" section in this README.
