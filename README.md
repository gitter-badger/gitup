# Git Uploader

## Dependencies:

As GitUp is a very simple script, it depends on only two packages:

- `bash`
- `git`

## Installation:

Run `./INSTALLER` script as root user (or maybe using `sudo`).

## Commands included:

Just type `gitup` and see the magic...

## TO-DO:

- [ ] Add more commands.

## Releases:

### Lastest:

- [0.2 "Drums"](https://github.com/feskyde/gitup/releases/tag/v0.2).

### Old:

- [0.1 "Castanets"](https://github.com/feskyde/gitup/releases/tag/v0.1).
 - [0.1.1](https://github.com/feskyde/gitup/releases/tag/v0.1.1) (Bugfixes).

## Important information:

### Unsupported distributions:

#### Ubuntu (and derivates):

GitUp is not compatible with Ubuntu and derivates because they not have the `source` command available for normal users.

`source` is a Bash built-in command that is used in GitUp to use all the variables from the `gitup.funcs` file.

GitUp will be still usable, but it will not make use of the functions included on the file mentioned above.
